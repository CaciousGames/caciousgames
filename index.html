												<h3>Knossos Uncovered</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
Dust, danger, and a labyrinth that never stays the same. Knossos Uncovered is a high-stakes tile-laying dungeon crawler that throws you and up to five friends directly into the heart of Crete. Forget predictable maps; in this shifting maze, the excavation builds itself as you explore. Whether you’re strategizing to outsmart a Minotaur or racing to pocket legendary relics before the walls shift, the pressure never lets up. The intuitive mechanics get you digging in minutes, and the ever-changing layout ensures no two excavations are ever the same. Will you work together to escape the crumbling ruins, or will you be the first to claim the glory? Grab your gear, watch your back, and get ready for a fast-paced descent into the world's most famous maze!</p>
